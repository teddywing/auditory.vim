auditory.vim
============

Interface sounds for vim. Sounds are played on various basic commands. In insert mode, a random note in a scale are played on each keypress.

Created at Music Hack Day Boston 2014.


**Note:** this is alpha software is still very buggy. Some mappings don't support counts when they should. A few audio files are available but the mappings haven't yet been implemented.


## Requirements

## Contributing
The code is a bit hackish at the moment. Any help improving the plugin is very much appreciated. Check the TODO file for ideas.
